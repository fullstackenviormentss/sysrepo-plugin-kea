This directory contains sample Kea configurations.

Note that Kea uses extended JSON for its configuration (i.e. JSON with allowed
bash-style comments. Lines starting with # are ignored). Many more examples
are available in kea sources in doc/examples/kea6 and doc/examples/kea4.

The examples are ordered in roughly increasing complexity.
